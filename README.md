### Background: 
This mini-project entails the implementation of two machine learning models - Linear Regression and Logistic Regression (with gradient descent) on two distinct datasets.

### Task 1: 
The initial phase involves data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis. The datasets under consideration are the [Boston Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data?select=boston) (Dataset 1) and the [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine) (Dataset 2). The process includes addressing missing or malformed features and gaining comprehensive insights into the data through fundamental statistical analysis.

### Task 2: 
The subsequent step encompasses the implementation of these models from the ground up using Python. The primary focus is on analytical linear regression for Dataset 1 and logistic regression with gradient descent for Dataset 2. Furthermore, it involves the incorporation of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

### Task 3: 
The final stage revolves around conducting a series of experiments. The datasets are partitioned into training and testing sets, and a range of experiments are executed, such as varying data splits, cross-validation, assessing the impact of training data size, minibatch sizes, and learning rates. Additionally, the exploration extends to Gaussian basis functions for Dataset 1 and a comparative analysis between analytical linear regression and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. The overarching objective is to evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance and select optimal parameter configurations for each dataset.
